# Awesome Flux

> :clipboard: A curated list about Flux's architecture and its implementations.


# Motivation

Motivation was born while I was writing my bachelor's thesis and couldn't find one place with all contents about Flux, its principles, the differences between MVC, implementations and others. So I decided to create this list to share my studies and resources that I found while working on my thesis (the document are avaiable in PT-BR [here](https://github.com/yanmagale/awesome-flux/tree/master/tcc.pdf) only PT-BR).

## Table of contents

- [MV* Arquitechtures](#mv*-arquitectures)
- [Flux Implementations](#mv*-implementations)
- [Redux](#redux)
